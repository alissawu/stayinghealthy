    <h1>GAME INSTRUCTIONS</h1>
    <p>
        Game: Use the up arrow to jump. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>   
        Obstacles: The minecraft blocks are obstacles. Jump over them, or you die.
    </p> 
    <p>
        Hand sanitizer: The hand sanitizers are lifesavers. Collect them by jumping into them. When you collect them, your character turns blue. They will give you an extra life, so if you crash into an obstacle, the obstacle will disappear and the game will keep going.  You can only hold one sanitizer at a time.     
    </p> 
    <p>
        Mask: The mask will give you a lifesaver effect, and shoot you up into the air. However, you need to answer a question to use the mask. If you answer wrong, you will die.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lifesaver Effect: Both hand sanitizers and masks will give you a lifesaver effect (you won't die the next time you crash into an obstacle). When the lifesaver is activated, your character will turn blue. When it is used up, your character will turn back red. 
    </p>
    <p>  
        Question: Questions will appear as an alert on the top of your screen. Type the letter corresponding to the right answer within the text box.
